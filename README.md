Guess the Number Game
Description
This is a console game written in Rust, where two players try to guess randomly generated numbers. Each player takes turns making a guess, and they try to guess the number generated by the computer. The game continues until the players decide to stop. The results of the game are saved to a file for later viewing.

How to Run
Prerequisites:
Rust (for compiling and running the game)

Playing the Game:

The game starts by asking for the players' names.
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated for each player.
Each player takes turns guessing the number.
If a player guesses the number correctly, they win the round.
The game continues until the players decide to stop.

Results Saving:
The results of the game are automatically saved to the file game_results.txt, which is created in the root directory of the project.
The file will store the scores after each round.

Example game_results.txt file:

Player1: 3, Player2: 2
Player1: 4, Player2: 3
